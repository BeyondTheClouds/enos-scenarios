#+TITLE: All In One Deployment

Performs an all-in-one deployment over vagrant/virtualbox.

To execute this scenario, pull the current git repository on your
system. Then update =reservation.yml= file so that the ~inventory~ and
~patches~ parameter link the current directory. Then make
an ~enos~ deployment with the =reservation.yml= as
reservation file.

: enos deploy -f ~/enos-scenario/all-in-one/reservation.yml

This also works on G5k, but it requires to change the ~provider~ and
~resources~ keys to be compliant with the G5k [[https://enos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/grid5000.html][configuration]].

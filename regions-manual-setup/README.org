#+TITLE: Multiple Regions Deployment

Test a multiple regions deployment. This scenario is made for testing
[[https://github.com/rcherrueau/kolla-ansible/tree/multi-regions][rcherrueau/kolla-ansible]].

To execute this scenario, pull the current git repository on G5k. Then
update =reservation-region*.yml= file so that the ~inventory~ and
~node_custom_config~ parameter link the current directory. Then make
an ~enos~ deployment with the =reservation-regionone.yml= as
reservation file.

: enos deploy -f ~/enos-scenario/region-manual-setup/reservation-regionone.yml

At the end of the up, note the ~vip~ value and report it into
=reservation-regiontwo.yml= at ~kolla-internal-fqdn-r1~. Then run the
deployment of the second region.

: enos deploy -f ~/enos-scenario/region-manual-setup/reservation-regiontwo.yml

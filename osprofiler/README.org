#+TITLE: Deployment with OSProfiler support

Performs a deployment over vagrant/virtualbox and configures services
to support [[https://docs.openstack.org/developer/osprofiler/][OSProfiler]].

To execute this scenario, pull the current git repository on your
system. Then update =reservation.yml= file so that the ~inventory~ and
~patches~ parameter link the current directory. Then make
an ~enos~ deployment with the =reservation.yml= as
reservation file.

: enos deploy -f ~/enos-scenario/all-in-one/reservation.yml

Finally, make a trace from the host.

: source current/admin-openrc
: openstack hypervisor list --os-profiler SECRET_KEY

Note that Keystone is not profiled. To activate it, change Keystone 
=patches/keystone.conf= configuration file and set the ~enable~ key 
to ~True~.

This also works on G5k, but it requires to change the ~provider~ and
~resources~ keys to be compliant with the G5k [[https://enos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/grid5000.html][configuration]].
